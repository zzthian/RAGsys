            "response": "In adults, especially those with diabetes, fevers are often caused by infections, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs) or respiratory infections, due to lowered resistance from diabetes. For diabetics, red flags to watch for include persistent or high-grade fever (102-103°F), uncontrolled blood sugar levels, symptoms like sweating, chills, or localized pain (e.g., back or abdominal pain), and signs of systemic infection (e.g., leukocytosis or hyponatremia). If these occur, medical evaluation (e.g., urine tests, blood cultures, imaging) is advised instead of managing at home. \n\nIf no such red flags are present, monitoring blood sugar closely and using antipyretics like paracetamol may help temporarily, but consulting a doctor is recommended if symptoms persist or worsen."

Like, would a super speedy Jolteon or a tough Steelix stand a chance? And do these Dragons usually team up in some way—like, does one of them set up rain or something to help the others?",
            "response": "Based on the provided material:\n\n- **Jolteon** (Electric type) has no particular advantage against Dragon types, as its Electric moves are neutral (1x) against Dragon. Its high speed (130) might help, but it lacks super-effective moves.\n\n- **Steelix** (Steel/Ground type) has a slight advantage, as Steel moves are 0.5x effective against Dragon. However, its Ground moves are neutral (1x). Its high defense (230) could help it survive longer.\n\n- **Vulpix** (Fire/Ice type) has Ice moves, which are super-effective (2x) against Dragon, making it a good choice.\n\n- **Rhydon** (Ground/Rock type) has no super-effective moves against Dragon, but its Rock moves are neutral (1x). Its high attack (130) might help, but it's not ideal.\n\nThe material does not mention whether Dragons team up with rain support or other strategies, so I don't know about that."
