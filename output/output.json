Its \"against_dragon\" value is 2, meaning it takes super effective damage from Dragon-type moves. To make it strong against Dragon-types, you could utilize its Ground-type moves, but the context does not specify its moveset or how to enhance its strength beyond its base stats and type advantages. I don't know."
