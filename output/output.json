            "response": "Dragon-types are generally weak to Ice, Fairy, and Dragon-type moves. Based on the provided material, Nidoran♀ and Nidorina (both Poison-types) have a resistance to Fairy-type moves (0.5x), but they don't have moves or types that directly exploit Dragon weaknesses. \n\nThe provided material does not include Pokémon with Ice, Fairy, or Dragon-type moves that could counter Dragon-types effectively. Therefore, I don't know the best way to exploit their shared weaknesses based on the given context."

            "query": "My rival's team is packed with Dragon-types—Dragonite, Altaria, Salamence, Flygon, Kingdra, and Hydreigon. Since Ice and Fairy moves are their biggest weaknesses, which Pokémon in those types can reliably take hits from them or outspeed to land super-effective blows? Bonus points if they can handle multiple members of their team without getting wrecked.",
            "response": "Based on the provided material, Dewgong (Water/Ice type) can be a good choice against Dragon-types due to its Ice typing, which is super effective against Dragonite, Flygon, and Kingdra. Dewgong has decent bulk with 90 HP, 80 Defense, and 95 Sp. Defense, and its Ice Body ability can help in hail. However, the material does not include information on Fairy-type Pokémon or other Ice-types like Mamoswine or Weavile, so I cannot recommend them.  \n\nFor handling multiple members:  \n- Dewgong can take hits from Kingdra (Water/Dragon) due to its Water resistance (0.25x) and Ice weakness (4x) from Dragonite.  \n- It also resists Flygon’s Ground moves (1x) but must watch for Flygon’s Dragon moves (2x).  \n\nNo Fairy-types are included in the material, so I cannot suggest any.  \n\nNote: The material lacks Altaria, Salamence, and Hydreigon’s data, so I cannot assess Dewgong’s performance against them.  \n\nAnswer: Dewgong (Water/Ice) can handle Kingdra and Flygon to some extent but struggles with Dragonite’s Ice weakness. No Fairy-types are listed in the material."

            "query": "Dewgong has its merits, but I'm worried about Altaria and Hydreigon. Are there any Fairy-types that can consistently knock out multiple Dragons on my rival's team, particularly those two? Bonus if they can also handle other members like Salamence or Kingdra.",
            "response": "Based on the provided context, there is no information about Fairy-type Pokémon that can consistently knock out multiple Dragons like Altaria and Hydreigon. Therefore, I don't know."

            "query": "Dewgong works against some of my rival's Dragons, but I'm still vulnerable to Altaria and Hydreigon. Are there any tanky Fairy or Ice-types—say, Togekiss or Mamoswine—that can both survive hits from this team and hit back hard with super-effective moves? Ideally, they'd also shrug off common coverage like Fire Blast or Dark Pulse.",
            "response": "Based on the provided material, **Mamoswine** could be a good option. It is an Ice/Ground type with high HP (110), Defense (80), and Attack (130). It resists Dragon-type moves (against_dragon: 1) and can hit back hard with Ice-type moves. However, it is weak to Fire (against_fire: 2) and Steel (against_steel: 2), so Fire Blast would be an issue.  \n\nFor Fairy-types, the provided material does not include Togekiss or other tanky Fairy-types, so I cannot confirm their viability.  \n\nThus, **Mamoswine** fits part of your criteria but is vulnerable to Fire Blast. For a Fairy-type, the data is unavailable."

For instance, does Altaria typically pack Fire Blast to handle Ice-types, or does Hydreigon often run Dark Pulse for Fairies? What other surprise moves should I anticipate to avoid getting wrecked?",
            "response": "Based on the provided material, here's what you should anticipate:\n\n1. **Altaria**: It has the ability **Cloud Nine**, which can negate weather effects, but the material does not specify its typical moveset (e.g., Fire Blast).  \n2. **Hydreigon**: It has **Dark Pulse** coverage (implied by its Dark typing and high **sp_attack** of 125), which can threaten Fairy-types.  \n\nFor the other Pokémon (Dragonite, Salamence, Flygon, Kingdra), the material does not provide moveset data, so I don't know.  \n\nBe cautious of Hydreigon's **Dark Pulse** for Fairy-types and watch for potential Fire-type coverage (though not confirmed for Altaria here).  \n\nFor other moves, I don't know."
