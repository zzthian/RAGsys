If current antibiotics aren’t working, your doctor may adjust them.\n5. **Self-care**: Rest, stay hydrated, and monitor your temperature. Seek emergency care if symptoms worsen (e.g., severe shortness of breath, high fever, or chest pain).\n\nThe exact cause and treatment depend on test results and clinical evaluation, so seeing a physician is crucial."

Avoid spicy/oily foods.  \n- If fever persists despite paracetamol, consult a doctor for further tests (e.g., full blood count, MP test, or S. tidal for typhoid suspicion).  \n\n**When to Seek Care**: If symptoms worsen, persist beyond a few days, or if red flags (e.g., prolonged fever, severe pain, or unusual rashes) appear, seek medical evaluation.  \n\n(Note: All advice is based on the retrieved context.)"

            "response": "Based on the provided context, here are some clear red flags that would indicate your phlegm is more than just allergies or a mild infection:  \n- **Persistent symptoms** (e.g., phlegm lasting for years or months, like in the third case).  \n- **Color changes** (e.g., green phlegm for a long time, as mentioned in the third case, or red/orange phlegm with severe coughing).  \n- **Difficulty breathing** (especially at night, as noted in the fourth case).  \n- **No improvement with antibiotics or OTC treatments** (suggests a chronic or resistant infection, like bronchiectasis or fungal infection).  \n- **Systemic symptoms** (e.g., headaches, frequent sickness, or fever—mentioned in the second case).  \n\nFor **OTC meds**, the context suggests:  \n- **Antihistamines** (e.g., cetirizine) for symptomatic relief (first case).  \n- **Expectorants** (not explicitly mentioned, but steam inhalation and saline gargles are recommended in multiple cases).  \n- **Pain relievers** (e.g., ibuprofen) for discomfort (first case).  \n\nHowever, the material strongly advises **against self-treatment** if symptoms persist or worsen, recommending a doctor’s evaluation (especially for antibiotics or chronic issues).

Ultrasound can confirm.\n   - **Neurofibroma**: Hard, mobile, and may cause nerve-related pain (e.g., radiating pain).\n   - **Sebaceous cyst/Sinus tract**: Spongey/liquid feeling, possibly foul odor or discharge, and may pulsate. FNAC or sonogram can confirm.\n\n**Red Flags**:\n   - Hardness (lipomas are never hard).\n   - Tenderness or pain (lipomas are usually painless unless compressing nerves).\n   - Changes with coughing (suggests hernia).\n   - Discharge, odor, or pulsation (suggests cyst/sinus tract).\n\nFor a definitive diagnosis, clinical examination and imaging (e.g., ultrasound) are recommended.

Prescription treatments are clearly better for severe, cystic, or persistent acne, especially when hormonal factors or deep inflammation are involved.

            "response": "Based on the provided context, you should generally expect to see some reduction in acne within **1 month** of starting a treatment, with **considerable clearing in 2-3 months**. However, results can vary depending on the type and severity of your acne, as well as individual factors like hormonal changes. \n\nIf you don’t see noticeable improvements after **4-6 weeks**, it may be a good idea to consult your dermatologist for potential adjustments to your treatment plan, such as adding or changing medications. For persistent or resistant acne, a prolonged course of oral isotretinoin (under medical supervision) may be needed for lasting results. \n\nIf no improvement is seen despite consistent treatment, follow up with your dermatologist for alternative therapies."
