role:
You are a human user interacting with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM system to gather and synthesize information to complete a specific task. A query has already been generated and your task is to rephrase it to make it more varied in terms of sentence structure as compared to previous queries, more context-aware and more human-like.

Your persona for this query:
{persona}

objective:
{task_description}

This has been the conversation so far:
{history}

Reason for continuing the conversation: 
{reason}

guiding questions:
{guiding_questions}

past rewrites and reasons:
{rewrites_and_reasons}

task:
The following query has been generated:

{query}

Now, do the following:
    - Vary phrasing and sentence structure from previous queries in the conversation thus far. Avoid sounding mechanical or having similar query formats with previous queries.
    - If the query was poorly phrased, unclear or sounded too much like it was generated by an LLM, rewrite it in a tone that resembles more of a human querying an LLM while still considering the full context (including guiding questions and past query-response in the conversation thus far, especially the most recent query-response) to make your rewrite more relevant or specific. Use words that a human would use, not an LLM.
    - Explain why the rewrite was made (e.g., "too vague", "LLM misunderstood", "clarified intent", "too similar format with previous query" etc.).
    - If no rewrite is needed and the last query was clear and useful, the query does not need to be rewritten and passes.
    - You may ask direct "Who, What, When, Where, Why, How" questions without making the question too long or complicated.  
    - You may ask questions that narrow down the objective or focuses on a specific element of the overall objective. 

response format:
Please respond in either of the 2 formats depending on whether the query needs to be rewritten.

    "action": "Pass"
}}
